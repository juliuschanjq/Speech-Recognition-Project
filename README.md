# Speech-Recognition-Project

The RAVDESS is a multimodal database of emotive speech and song that has been verified.
The database is gender balanced, with 24 professional actors performing the same phrases in a neutral North American accent![image](https://github.com/juliuschanjq/Speech-Recognition-Project/assets/113488890/b9b25ead-d5ee-459f-9b80-cf8bae1f1a81)

The Web Application will operate on the Streamlit library alongside the loaded model using Tensorflow and the Speech to Text API. 

The application will be utilising the upload of file function where audio samples are uploaded & show the result of the emotion based on the audio file which then transcribe the audio to text as well.
